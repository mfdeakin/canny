Basically just implements a canny edge detector.

Steps
It reads in a 32 bit color bitmap with a Windows Bitmap Header
Converts it to grayscale using a luminance calculation
Applies a Gaussian Blur to it (size and variance of the blur matrix can be changed)
Applies a modified Sobel gradient (more accurate than vanilla Sobel; about as close to a true gradient operator as possible with square pixels)
Runs the Canny Algorithm to complete the process.
All that's left to do is the hard part of the Canny Algorithm, connecting the line segments
